# Changelog

All notable changes to `tool-eval-bench` are documented here.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Context pressure** (`--context-pressure`) — pre-fill the context window with
  alternating user/assistant filler turns before each scenario to test tool-calling
  quality under context pressure. Auto-detects context window size from `/v1/models`
  (`max_model_len` on vLLM); use `--context-size` to override.
- **Cache-busting filler** — filler content draws from 12 diverse paragraph styles
  (tech docs, meeting notes, code reviews, etc.), shuffled per run, with random
  noise tokens (ticket IDs, timestamps, IPs, versions) injected at sentence
  boundaries and unique nonce prefixes per chunk. This defeats vLLM/llama.cpp
  prefix caching for accurate pressure measurement.
- `--context-size` flag to manually specify context window size when auto-detection
  is unavailable.
- Progress bar during context pressure fill.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-17

### Initial Public Release

**63 deterministic scenarios** across **14 categories** (A–N) for evaluating
LLM tool-calling quality in agentic workflows.

### Features

- **Tool-call quality benchmark** — 63 scenarios testing tool selection,
  parameter precision, multi-step chains, error recovery, safety boundaries,
  autonomous planning, creative composition, and more.
- **3-tier scoring** — each scenario scored as pass (2 pts), partial (1 pt),
  or fail (0 pts) with deterministic evaluators.
- **Safety gating** — Category K failures cap the rating at ★★★ Adequate
  regardless of the overall numeric score.
- **Throughput benchmark** (`--perf`) — llama-bench style pp/tg measurement
  with configurable context depth and concurrency sweeps.
- **Speculative decoding benchmark** (`--spec-bench`) — measures effective t/s,
  acceptance rate (α), and speedup ratio for MTP/draft/ngram/eagle methods.
- **Multi-trial statistics** (`--trials N`) — mean ± stddev, 95% bootstrap CI,
  Pass@k / Pass^k reliability metrics.
- **Error injection** (`--error-rate`) — simulate HTTP 429/500/503 errors to
  test model robustness under failure conditions.
- **Deployability scoring** — composite quality × responsiveness metric with
  configurable weight (`--alpha`).
- **Deterministic payload noise** — all mock tool responses enriched with
  realistic metadata (timestamps, IDs, nested objects) to test signal extraction.
- **Run persistence** — SQLite storage + Markdown reports with full traces.
- **Run comparison** — `--diff`, `--compare`, `--history` for tracking
  model performance over time.
- **Backend support** — any OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint:
  vLLM, LiteLLM, llama.cpp.
- **Model auto-detection** — queries `/v1/models` and presents an interactive
  picker when multiple models are available.
